# DS-Training
Training pipeline of projects for people new to data science and machine learning. 

Jupyter Notebooks listed use code and data that are open source.

The training pipeline is a compilation of different tutorials and guides pulled from these resources:

* machinelearningmastery.com/blog
* kaggle.com
* datacamp.com/community/tutorials
* Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet


Principles of training:
* self-guided research.
* practical, hands-on Jupyter Notebooks. notebooks are comprised of 'skeleton' code that students have to fill in.
* Practitioner mindset. Guides developed with the goal of a becoming a machine learning practitioner. Little to no math is covered.

TO-DO:
* add a YouTube video lesson for each Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to turn this training into a repeatable process without much oversight needed.
